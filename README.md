## CS-230
In this class I learned the foundational differences between operating systems. I learned how their components talk to eachother, how they manage memory, and how secure they are. I then used that knowledge and applied it to the projects throughout the course that involved analyzing design requirements for applications. 

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only. The staff is not knowledgable of how to set up the new web-based enviornment and has requested a software design document. This will give them a rundown of the different constraints and issues that may arise in this task when dealing with different operating platforms. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  This was tougher than I expected it to be. I learned a lot from my mistakes, but I think what I did particularly well was breaking down the differences in developing on each platform. Stating the differences in servers, functions, development process, and UI constraints. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  The UIL diagram was a great visual representation of how my code should flow and interact. I liked being able to connect the different lines and add the custom variables to better visualize how all of the files should work together. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I think I would like to do the whole thing over again, but with the knowledge I have now. I always had a sense of uncertainty when filling out this form, but now that im more familiar with the concepts I think I would be more comfotable with it this time around. I think I would improve it by keeping my focus on how web-based applications run on different browsers and operating systems instead of the operating systems themselves.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  The customer is always right! If we arent designing what they want, why did they hire us? The user is in charge of the vision, and the developer is in charge of making that a reality. Like a restaurants and we are the chefs. The most important thing in development is communication, and as we learned when learning about SCRUM/Agile methodoligies: The clearer the vision is of the end product, the more likely we are to produce that vision. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  Before when I made my other apps, I did the bare minimum of planning. Im talking drawing bubbles and lines. Now I can see the importance of planning out your disign approach. It might take more time and consideration, but the payoff is a more stable picture of what it is you're creating. I think about it like cooking. When I have all of my ingredients prepped and ready, it makes cooking easier. This is the same when designing software. When designing in future projects, I will implement UIL diagrams, as well as pseudocode to layout the foundation.
